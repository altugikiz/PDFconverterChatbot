"No Filter"

Damn the rules, and screw the game,
They built this world, it's all the same.
Liars rise, the real ones fall,
Yet we stand tall, f*** 'em all.

Bullsht smiles, fake-ass grace,
Two-faced cowards, a damn disgrace.
Preaching love with hands in chains,
Selling hope, just f**ing stains.

Burn their scripts, break their chains,
Spit the truth, embrace the flames.
No regrets, no damn fear,
F*** their whispers, we stay clear.
